Read more incorvergent work, but here are a couple major themes
-start with a base shape or line
- draw another, whether node, pixel, or line
- hae a rule and a place for randomization

Different algorithims that inconvergent use
1. Draw lines that trace an original line
2. Based on intestines and things that fold in on each other, start with a circle, draw a node between them that is has some randomized position relative to the line.
